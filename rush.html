            <h2 class="header">A letter from the men of Delta Sigma Phi</h2>
            <p>The men of Delta Sigma Phi would like to welcome you to Rose-Hulman and encourage you to consider the
              benefits associated with joining a fraternity seriously. The next six weeks will be very enlightening as
              to what Greek life is all about. We
              understand that Greek life is not for every man, but we request that you keep an open mind to fraternities
              in general. We do hope that you experience the fall rush to learn about the life-long commitments,
              life-long friendships, and life-changing
              experiences that Greek life will provide.</p>
            <p>At Delta Sigma Phi, we are committed to building better men through leadership, campus involvement, and
              our dedicated principles of chivalry and loyalty to man. We are also a very diverse fraternity, which can
              be traced historically to the fraternity's
              founding at the City College of New york in 1899, where Delta Sig was established uniquely on the
              principle of religious tolerance between Christianity and Judaism. We also follow a strict no-hazing
              policy for all members and new members.</p>
            <p>The Zeta Lambda Chapter of the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity can be found at 429 S. 6th Street in downtown
              Terre Haute. Although we may be off-campus, we find that living away from Rose-Hulman is a fantastic way
              to get a break from the hard and stressful
              work that our education sometimes provides.</p>
            <p>On campus, you will find Delta Sig's involved with many clubs, sports, and residence hall staff. We are
              currently very active with the Paintball Club, Outdoor Venture Club, The Monkey, and the Student Alumni
              Association, just to name a few. We
              also have brothers on the swimming and cross-country teams. Being such a diverse group of men at Delta Sig
              makes it easy for anyone to find a common interest with our brothers.</p>
            <p>We also highly value service to the community here at Delta Sigma Phi. We annually are involved with
              fraternity service projects directly benefiting the American Red Cross and the March of Dimes. We
              encourage all brothers to participate in other
              community service events, and are always involved with any Rose-Hulman sponsored service events.</p>
            <p>Of course, at Rose-Hulman, we are all here to get a great education, and the men of Delta Sigma Phi fully
              commit to making academics as good as possible. Brothers of Delta Sig are always working together on their
              coursework, helping each other
              with homework and other schoolwork. We find that being directly connected with older brothers who have
              taken the classes you need to take to be a great peer-tutoring network. Our study habits support that
              Delta Sigma Phi holds one of the best
              academic averages on campus.</p>
            <p>And at Delta Sigma Phi, we do like having fun, too. We hold regular events with all Rose-Hulman
              sororities as well as ISU sororities. We also schedule exclusive brother-only events on many weekends,
              such as cookouts, road trips, and other fun
              things to do outside of Terre Haute. Being a Delta Sig will provide some of the best experiences you can
              ask for in college, and will result in lifelong relationships that would not otherwise occur as a regular
              Rose-Hulman student.</p>
            <p>The bond of brotherhood in Delta Sig does not end with graduation, however. Our alumni regularly return
              to our house and give back to Delta Sig. The time invested in brotherhood at Delta Sig will have lifelong
              rewards, and our alumni are proof
              of what is to come from joining Delta Sig.</p>
            <p>We all are very excited to meet each and every one of you. We hope that you truly enjoy your experience
              in rush in the next six weeks, and we appreciate your interest in exploring what being part of Delta Sigma
              Phi is all about. </p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>
