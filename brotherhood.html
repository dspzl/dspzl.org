              <p>The men of Delta Sigma Phi strive for a balanced life of academics and social interaction. We host several parties every year at our house on South Sixth Street in downtown Terre Haute and engage in socials with sororities from both Rose and Indiana
                State University. Parties we have hosted in our time at Rose include Festival of Bacchus, Heaven and Hell, Sexy Santa, Mafia, Camp Out, and of course Around the World. In the past, we have invited the women of Delta Delta Delta, Chi Omega, Alpha
                Omicron Pi, Delta Gamma and others to join us for social mixers including bowling, game nights, cook outs, volunteering at the humane society, and much more. We attempt to have a social with every sorority on Rose-Hulman's campus at least once per
                quarter. The culmination of the social life of our fraternity is the Carnation Ball, which is a formal event held in the spring of every year. Delta Sigs make every effort to be well-rounded individuals, who understand the value and importance of
                social interaction.</p>

              <p>Activities are just fun things we do as a brotherhood to get away from school work and studying for a little while. Besides intramural sports, some activities we have
                had in the past include canoe trips, attending professional sporting events, and car shows. If there is an event someone thinks everyone would enjoy and we have money
                 in the budget, we will look into it and plan to make it happen. It is always fun spending some time with your Delta Sig brothers with activities.</p>

              <p>The Zeta Lambda chapter of Delta Sigma Phi at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology is constantly seeking to promote philanthropic efforts in order to serve the
                community. The most prominent relationship that Delta Sigma Phi shares is with the March of Dimes. While community service is a staple activity in the fraternity,
                the largest event that the fraternity hosts and supports is the annual 24-hour Basketball Marathon. The marathon raises funds each winter for the March of Dimes.
                 Delta Sigma Phi is consistently acknowledged by the March of Dimes as one of the highest donating groups.</p>
